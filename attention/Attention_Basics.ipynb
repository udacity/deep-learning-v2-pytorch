    "In this notebook, we look at how attention is implemented. We will focus on implementing attention in isolation from a larger model. That's because when implementing attention in a real-world model, a lot of the focus goes into piping the data and juggling the various vectors rather than the concepts of attention themselves.\n",

The first input to the scoring function is the hidden state of decoder (assuming a toy RNN with three hidden nodes -- not usable in real life, but easier to illustrate):"
